rorqual (finner)
================

TL;DR: Like Apache OpenNLP (TokenNameFinder) but faster and actually working.

Detects all kinds of entities in financial news texts, like ISINs,
FIGIs (BBGIDs), monetary values, date and time stamps, etc.

Unlike the NERs from the big NLP packages this is rule based and hence
the false positive rate is low while the false negative rate is zero.
