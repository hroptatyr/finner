On Apr 2, 2000 the world is going to end.
Two days before it was Apr 0, 2000.
And Apr 32, 2000 is invalid.
Or was it June 04, 2000?
No I'm certain it was 11/12/2000 and not 13/12/2000.
And 13/13/2000 is invalid.
So is 12/40/2012.
Or 40/12/2012.
Nor does 00/12/2000 work.
But 4/4/2000 is fine.
So is 5/15/2000,
And 16/4/2008.
Some people write dates like 06 Jun 2012.
Or I've seen 4-Jan-2009.
And even 16/May/2019 But 32/May/2019 doesn't work.
