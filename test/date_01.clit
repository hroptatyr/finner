On Apr 2, 2000/date the world is going to end.
Two days before it was Apr 0, 2000.
And Apr 32, 2000 is invalid.
Or was it June 04, 2000/date?
No I'm certain it was 11/12/2000/date and not 13/12/2000/date.
And 13/num/13/2000 is invalid.
So is 12/num/40/2012.
Or 40/num/12/2012.
Nor does 00/12/2000 work.
But 4/4/2000/date is fine.
So is 5/15/2000/date,
And 16/4/2008/date.
Some people write dates like 06 Jun 2012/date.
Or I've seen 4-Jan-2009/date.
And even 16/May/2019/date But 32/num/May/2019 doesn't work.
